# *Ranitomeya imitator* developmental series 

In this project, we attempt to examine genes that contribute to the production of color and pattern phenotypes in the mimic poison frog *Ranitomeya imitator.* We use RNA seq data collected from tadpoles at various stages of development from four different color morphs. 

Transcriptome assembly, read cleaning, and transcript expression quantification is all done in bash. Subsequent differential gene expression analyses are in the R markdown file.
